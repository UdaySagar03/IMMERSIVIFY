Task 1 - Titanic Survival Prediction
The goal of this task is to develop a model that accurately predicts whether a
passenger survived the Titanic disaster using the Titanic dataset. This dataset
includes features such as passenger age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin, all of
which can be used to train a predictive model. The project involves handling and
preprocessing data, selecting key features, and applying machine learning
techniques to build a model that effectively classifies survival outcomes

Task 2 - Movie Rating Prediction
This task involves creating a model to predict a movie's rating based on features such
as genre, director, and actors. Using regression techniques, the aim is to analyze
historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating
assigned by users or critics. This project will require you to apply data analysis,
preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning skills to explore how
different factors influence movie ratings.

Task 3 - Iris Flower Classification
In this task, you will develop a model to classify Iris flowers into three species—
Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their sepal and petal measurements. 
Using the classic Iris dataset, which provides measurement data for each species,
your objective is to train a machine learning model capable of accurately
categorizing flowers by species. This project serves as an introductory classification
task, allowing you to explore fundamental machine learning concepts.

Task 4 - Sales Prediction
In this task, you will develop a machine learning model to forecast product sales
based on various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience
segmentation, and advertising platform selection. Sales prediction is a key
responsibility for data scientists in businesses, as it helps in understanding future
sales trends and optimizing marketing strategies. Using Python, you will analyze and
interpret data to make accurate sales predictions, enabling businesses to optimize
their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

Task 5 - Credit Card Fraud Detection
In this task, you will build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions. The project involves preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, addressing class imbalance issues, and splitting the dataset into training and testing
sets. You will then train a classification model, such as logistic regression or random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Model performance will be
evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and techniques such as
oversampling or undersampling may be applied to improve results.
